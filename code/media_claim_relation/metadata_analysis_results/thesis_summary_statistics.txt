SUMMARY STATISTICS FOR THESIS
==================================================

Key Findings:
1. Missing Important Context overlap:
   - Slanted: 76.1%
   - Unreliable Source: 64.7%
   - Demonstrates substantial overlap in metadata signals

2. Category Similarity Analysis:
   - 1072/1072 pairs with >80% similarity
   - Highest similarity score: 1.000
   - Average similarity: 1.000

3. Implications:
   - Metadata enhancement failed due to overlapping signal patterns
   - Traditional text-only classification may be more effective
   - Need for more discriminative metadata features
