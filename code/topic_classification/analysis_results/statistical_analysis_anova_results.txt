CORRELATION ANALYSIS (Note-Level, n = 22,092):
--------------------------------------------------
Disagreement ↔ Helpfulness: r = -0.860, p = 0.000
Disagreement ↔ Engagement: r = +0.055, p = 0.000
Helpfulness ↔ Engagement: r = +0.005, p = 0.420

STATISTICAL SUMMARY FOR MANUSCRIPT:
--------------------------------------------------
APA Format:
Disagreement: F(6, 22085) = 45.4, p <0.001, η² = 0.012
Net Helpfulness: F(6, 22085) = 69.9, p <0.001, η² = 0.019

LaTeX Format:
Disagreement: $F(6,22085) = 45.4$, $p <0.001$, $\eta^2 = 0.012$
Net Helpfulness: $F(6,22085) = 69.9$, $p <0.001$, $\eta^2 = 0.019$

INTERPRETATION:
------------------------------
Key Findings:
1. Theme significantly predicts both disagreement and helpfulness
2. Effect sizes are small for disagreement and small for helpfulness
3. Note-level correlation between disagreement and helpfulness: r = -0.860

Implications:
- Misinformation domain meaningfully predicts community moderation outcomes
- Systematic differences exist between themes in evaluation patterns
- Theme-based approach to understanding community notes effectiveness is supported
