\section{Comprehensive BART Model Experiments}

\subsection{Experiment Overview}
We conducted comprehensive experiments testing 48 different configurations across 2 experimental setups and 3 model architectures. The experiments evaluated the impact of including versus excluding the problematic 'other' class from training, along with confidence threshold optimization.

\subsection{Optimal Configuration}
The best performing configuration achieved 90.6% committed accuracy with 84.8\% coverage using the combined model in the without other experiment with a confidence threshold of 0.95.
